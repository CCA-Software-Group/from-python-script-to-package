# Goals

* Show how a Python script evolves into a full-fledged installable package, step-by-step
* Expose each step in this git repository as runnable code so that people can jump around easily

# Non-goals

* Providing exhaustive coverage of alternatives when multiple tools exist
* Using git history as the mechanism to record/show the evolution from stage to stage
